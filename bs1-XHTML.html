<h1> Sign Language </h1>

	<h2 id="Intro"> Introduction</h2>
	
<p> Sign language is a language that uses manual communication to convey
meaning. This can include the use of gestures, movement, orientation
of the fingers, arms or body and facial expressions. Sign languages
are mainly used by the deaf and hard of hearing but are also used by
hearing individuals. For example, those unable to physically speak, or
those who have trouble speaking.

<p>One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the
fifth century BC. Specifically, in Plato's <em>Cratylus</em>, Socrates states:
<em>"If we hadn't a voice or tongue, and wanted to express things to
one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head
and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?"</em></p>

<p>Until the 19th Century, most of our knowledge of historical sign
languages has been limited to manual alphabets such as fingerspelling
(or <strong>dactylogy</strong>), which is the representation of the letters (and
numbers) of the writing systems using only the hands, rather than on
the documentation of sign languages.</p>

<p>Many sign languages have developed independently throughout the world,
and with little documentation no first sign language can be
identified. However, the most recorded instances of sign languages
seem to occur in Europe, during the 17th Century.</p>

<p>In 1680, George Delgarno published his own method of deaf education in
<em>Didascalocophus</em>, aka, <em>The deaf and dumb mans tutor.</em> This publication
included an "arthrological" alphabet, where letters are indicated by
pointing to different joints of the fingers and palms. The vowels of 
this alphabet have survived in the contemporary alphabets used in
<a href =" BSL" >British Sign Language </a>, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language
(BANZL).</p>

<p>Generally, each country has its own native sign language that is
similar to their spoken counterpart, however the grammar and sentence
structure may vary to encourage efficiency and fluidity. This is
further complicated by regional variations, similar to the regional
dialects found in spoken languages. In addition, only some are
formally recognised. Therefore, it is unclear how many sign languages
exist worldwide. In the 2017 edition of<a href = "https://www.ethnologue.com/"> ethnologue </a> they only list 142
sign languages.

<p>While we are unable to list all variations of sign language,
linguistics may classify sign languages by how they arise: </p>
<ul>

<li> <strong>Home sign (languages) </strong> arise in non-signing communities where the deaf
individual is not educated in sign and lacks contact with other deaf
individuals. The result is therefore not a full language, but closer
to a pidgin </li>

<li> <strong>Village sign languages </strong> arise over several generations in a relatively
insular community with a high incidence of deafness, and is used both
by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community, who
have deaf family and friends</li>

<li> <strong>Deaf-community sign languages</strong> arise where deaf people come together to
form their own communities</li>

<li> <strong>Speech-taboo languages</strong> contrast with both languages as they are
developed by the hearing community and used secondarily by the deaf </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, while it may be difficult, due to language contact and
evolution, we can classify sign languages into families (see Figure on
The Classification of Sign Language Families).</p>

 <p> Celebrating British Sign Language and Braidwood's Academy by <a href="http://www.google.co.uk"> Google UK </a></p>

<p>British Sign Language (BSL) is a sign language used in the United
Kingdom. It has existed since the 1570s and like all languages, has
evolved by modification, invention and importation. Since 18th March
2003, the UK government has formally recognised BSL as its own
language. It is believed that there are at least 151,000 people who
use BSL in the UK of which only 87,000 are deaf.</p>

<p>The first known school for the deaf was the Braidwood's Academy, which
was founded in Edinburgh, 1760. Last year Google celebrated BSL and
the Academy in one of its <a href = "https://www.google.com/doodles">Google Doodles.</a> Their aim was not just to
celebrate but also to show <em>the importance of education for all
students with diversity of needs".</em>"</p>

<p>BSL can be learned throughout the UK and examination systems. You can
find courses in community colleges, local centres and private
organisations. Locally, you can study BSL part-time courses at
Newcastle College who provide the following AQA qualifications: </p>
<ul>

<li>Signature Level 1 Award (elementary)</li>
<li>Signature Level 2 Certificate (intermediate)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the meantime, you can start off your optional and informal
education in BSL by learning to sign the alphabet and numbers.</p>
